<h2>Design Your Life- Good Time Journal</h2>
<h4>PITCH</h4>
<h5>Based on the Design Your Life course at Stanford, this app helps you figure out which activities bring you enjoyment, energy, and engagement. These clues are the first step you need to take to design your ideal life. The journal includes an activity log and a reflection log. Activity logs record daily your main activities, and a gauge to show how engaged and energized you were. Reflection logs are done once a week to record your trends, insights and surprises as to what activities work and don't work for you.<h5

Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
